# Project PRD Reference Rule

## Always Reference the PRD
Before starting any development work, ALWAYS read and reference the project PRD located at `docs/project-prd.md`. This document contains:

- **Product Vision**: Fallout-themed personal finance management app
- **Technical Stack**: React 18+ with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Zustand, Dexie.js
- **Core Features**: Terminal interface, financial management, gamification system
- **Development Phases**: 5 phases over 16 weeks
- **Architecture**: Data models, command structure, UI/UX specifications

## Todo List Creation Guidelines

When creating todolists, follow these patterns based on the PRD:

### Phase-Based Organization
Break down tasks according to the 5 development phases outlined in the PRD:
1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-3): Project setup, basic terminal UI, command parser
2. **Core Features** (Weeks 4-6): CRUD operations, analytics, reporting
3. **Gamification** (Weeks 7-9): XP system, achievements, shop
4. **Polish & Content** (Weeks 10-12): Themes, ASCII pets, lore
5. **Cloud Features** (Weeks 13-16): Backend, authentication, sync

### Feature-Specific Todos
Create todos that align with PRD features:
- **Terminal Interface**: Boot sequence, command parsing, ASCII styling
- **Financial Management**: Transaction CRUD, analytics, reporting
- **Gamification**: XP system, achievements, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats
- **Shop & Unlockables**: Points economy, themes, pets, lore packs

### Technical Implementation
Reference the technical specifications from the PRD:
- Use specified tech stack (React 18+, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, etc.)
- Follow data architecture interfaces (UserProfile, Transaction, GameState)
- Implement command structure as defined in section 3.1.2
- Maintain performance requirements (<3s load, <100ms command response)

### Success Metrics Alignment
Ensure todos contribute to measurable outcomes:
- User engagement metrics (DAU/MAU, session duration)
- Financial impact (transaction tracking, budget adherence)
- Gamification success (achievement unlocks, level progression)

## Command Structure Reference
Always implement commands following the PRD specification:
```bash
# Financial Commands
add <amount> <category> "<description>" [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
spend <amount> <category> "<description>" [--recurring]
balance [--detailed]
summary <period> [--export]

# Goals Commands
goal create <name> <target_amount> <deadline>
goal progress <name>

# Gaming Commands
stats
achievements
shop
inventory
```

## Data Model Compliance
Ensure all data structures follow the PRD interfaces:
- UserProfile with vaultDwellerId, XP, level, achievements
- Transaction with type, amount, category, XP earned
- GameState with balance, budget, goals, shop points

## UI/UX Standards
Maintain Fallout terminal aesthetic:
- Color scheme: Amber phosphor (#00ff41), terminal brown (#3d2817)
- Typography: "Share Tech Mono" or "VT323" monospace
- ASCII art styling for charts and graphics
- Terminal glow effects and authentic boot sequence
